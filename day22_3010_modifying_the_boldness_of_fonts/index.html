    <p>
        CSS is one of the core languages of
        <span class="point">the Open Web</span>
        and is standardised across browsers by the <span class="slim">W3C</span> specification.
        CSS saves a lot of work. Styles can be saved externally by definition.
        This means that developers do not have to go through the hassle of editing the layout on all pages.
        <span class="rough"> CSS is divided into different levels: </span>
        CSS1 is now deprecated,
        CSS2.1 is the recommended standard and
        <span class="important">CSS3 is divided into smaller modules and is in the process of being standardised.</span>
